3. Free Response: Please discuss any challenges you had this week and how you overcame them
This week I faced a challange outside of coding. I was mountain biking and on marhsall and it started to rain. I got to the sumit of the easy up and at this point the trail was puddling. Thier were two things now at the forfront of my mind. I would damage the trails and increase risk of injury. After some thinking I decided to ride backdown the gravel road i went up. It eneded up being fun because of the rain, didnt damage the singletrack and got down safe.
