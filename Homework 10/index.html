 <strong>Cars and transportation in this Era</strong> Mass production methods made automobiles affordable for the masses instead of just the rich. By 1921, the number of automobiles in the United States had passed the ten million mark. Also In the 1920's, trains and ocean liners were the dominant mass transportation methods, providing comfortable, reliable transport to millions of American vacationers. Trains had opened up the continent and ships the world, but newer methods of transport captured the imagination of the public and reduced travel times.

 <strong>When the prohibiton emerged </strong> The 18th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution banned the manufacture, transportation and sale of intoxicating liquors. This ushered in a period in American history known as Prohibition. Prohibition was ratified by the states on January 16, 1919 and officially went into effect on January 17, 1920, with the passage of the Volstead Act.

     <strong>Party Scene in the 20's</strong> The 1920s era in nightlife was one in which you had to evolve or die. With Prohibition taking legal alcohol off the table, clubs had to be sexy and appealing enough that patrons would risk arrest to go. There were two categories of venues, the speakeasy that was operating and selling liquor illegally and then legal clubs that weren't visibly selling liquor and where patrons would come in with their own flasks and would pay covers and buy mixers. One of the most famous bars was the country club this place just fascinated me. Heres a quote from papermag about the club , "The owner Belle Livingstone, would always lounge around in red silk pajamas. The club featured live music, and had ping pong and mini golf within the venue. There was the Pirates' Den, which had marine posters all over the walls and waiters dressed up as pirates who every so often would stage sword fights while the guests would swill cider from mugs. They would also experience a mock storm every few hours where thunder sheets would rattle and lights would flash and water would be sprayed in the air"
