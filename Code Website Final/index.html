            My name is Margaret Harmon a Junior Media Arts student at the University of Montana. I focus in digital arts and printing mediums,
            I have loved the oportunity to learn and grow as an artist at this University. Not only has this school provided educational growth 
            I have experienced relationship developments, and life lessons. Throughout my time her I have started mountain biking, birding, and
            rock climbing making amazing freinds along the way.

        <div class="second-paragraph">
            The intention of this Webpage is to talk about my inspirations, future visions, and display some of my current work.

           For the Future I dream of owning a graphic design ferm with my best friend, or doing freelance work for the beggining of my 
           carrer and traveling Asia for a few years. I dream of working in an environment where the people next to me are kind and helpful.
           I switched marketing carrers to Media Arts because I know my soul would slowly die being in a cubicle working with people that 
           are working zombies. I think when 20 year olds talk about their future and act like it is certanty they are kidding themselves. 
           Your past always looks different then for your original intentions, to plan years ahead almost seems to be a waste of time. All I know 
           Is when I wake up I will asses and make the most out of the day and pursue my current dream.
            </div>
        </div>
        <div>
        Throughout the rest of my life I want to persue different mediums and explore my creativity. Currently I am learning more about print making
        and adobe softwares. I hop to balance a job and side jobs that are my passions in my furture.
