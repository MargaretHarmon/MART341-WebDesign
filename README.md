        1. Briefly describe the difference between divs, classes, ids, and spans.
            Span and div are both basic forms of html, they can help group different parts of the web page. Span is sepcifically used to group inline elements. While div is a block element of html. an Id attribute is used to label things within your website. Classes simplifies styling so you can use CSS to style multiple at once. 
            
        2. Talk about the advantages and disadvantages of using a service like YouTube or
         Vimeo to host your videos?
            The disadvantages come with many copyrighting issues. For example I had a video of myself and freinds in walmart on youtube, the video got taken off because their was a distant popular song from bruno mars playing in the backround from the overhead speakers in the store. Advantages are the platfrom has thousands of consumers, and has a relatively easy upload process.
        3. Free Response: What challenges did you have this week? How did you
        overcome them?
           I was challeneged with how to not have my lyric text disapear. I couldnt figure out how to actually get them into readable paragraphs even thoug I used the <p><p/> commands. I did not overcome this treid to find videos online and go through the online walk through but just got more confused.

1. Briefly recap your experience learning HTML. What was old, new, interesting, or
difficult to learn?
    Most was new and very interesting. My only experince with coding has been through your creative coding class witch was AWSOME, and now this class!
2. Next module we continue with CSS and expand on styling, which helps us
"decorate" HTML. Is there anything you're anxious or excited to learn about in
this new section?
    Yes just building in a more graphic style to websites. It has been challanging for me to understand how to make the simplest html pages I cannot imagine
    the difficulty creating modern day websites would be like. 
3. Free Response: Summarize your challenges and successes. What did you do to
overcome your challenges?
    I got my images to show up!!! I was very happy about that:) My challange is getting my youtube links to show up, i always seem to mess that up.
