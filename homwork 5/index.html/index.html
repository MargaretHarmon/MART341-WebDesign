            My story is about my golden birthday when I turned 12 on April 12th. It was easter on my birthday witch I loved, 
            I got to wear a new dress, and hang out with my family all morning. When I got home I found the most epic bouncy 
            castle in my back yard. All my neighboorhood friends were outside and we jumped and played outside until sunset.
