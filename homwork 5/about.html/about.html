                Doreen Cronin lives in Brooklyn, New York. Is the author for many 
             New York Times bestselling child books. Unfortunatly it seems that 90%
             of the rest of her books were click clack moo spinoffs. I dont aprecciate
             this because I belive it can turn a good thing bad, and can indicate greediness
             over quality
