                <strong>Why did you choose this project?</strong>
                <ol>
                    <li> Mountain Biking has become a new hobbie of mine over the past year. My freinds in the sport have encouraged me to 
                        learn this trick. Today I was at rattlesnake trying to get better, pedeled to hard and did not have my hand on the 
                        brake and feel to the ground. I choose this prodject because im passionate about it! </li>

                <strong>What does it mean for you?</strong>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        It means that I have a escape from a rough day. I can hop on my bike and have no other thoughts but the one aproaching me.
