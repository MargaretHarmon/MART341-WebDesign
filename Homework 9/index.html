        <div><h2>Step 1 - Find a open space</h2></div>
        <div style="margin:auto; padding:10px">
            <span style="padding:40px;">
                <p>Find either grass or soft dirt so that if you fall it wont hurt as bad. Secondly
                Its best to be slight uphill so its easier to get your front wheel off the ground.
                </p>

        <div><h2>Step 2 -Position your weight on the bike </h2></div>
        <div style="margin:auto; padding:20px">
        <span style="padding:40px;">
        <p>Point your bike up the hill, and find your leading foot. By this I mean what is your dominat foot and use that 
        as your first pedal for more power. Then with your arms straight and hands resting on the brakes, press yourself up from 
        seat a few inches. Then move your weight fast to the backrear tire, this should pop your front tire off the ground. The
        Next step will be timing your pedeling with this pump.
        </p>

        </div>

        <div><h2>Step 3 - Introducing pedaling</h2></div>
        <div style="margin:auto; padding:10px">
            <span style="padding:40px">
                <p> In step 2 your tire did not get very high off the ground and it only lasted a brief moment. Pedeling at the right speed
                    and time is what allows you to get a higher manual and to ride in a wheelie. Positon your pedels so your leding foot will
                    be most powerful when you shift your weight to the back tire and your front comes off the ground. Get a slow pace up the 
                    hill and when you pop your front tire up pedel with your leading foot. And keep pedaling, this force should shoot your front 
                    tire up, now make sure your hand is ready to apply the brake. If you pedel with no resistance the bike will fly out front 
                    underneath you. The brake is also what will bring your bike back to level.
