    <h1>Exploring SnapDragons</h1>
    <h3>Antirrhinum is a genus of plants commonly known as dragon flowers or snapdragons because of the flowers' fancied resemblance to the face of a dragon that opens and closes its mouth when laterally squeezed.</h3>

            While their actual origin is unknown, it’s believed that snapdragons were originally wildflowers in Spain and Italy. This flower originated in the Mediterranean area but now thrives in the UK when planted 
            in well-fertilized soil in full sun. The English name derives from the flower’s imagined appearance as a dragon’s face. Snapdragons come in a wide variety of bright colors and a range of heights, from dwarf 
            to medium and tall. In addition to growing the plants for cut flowers, the seeds have been used to extract edible oils, while the leaves and flowers have been considered to possess anti-inflammatory properties.

            The Romans and Greeks thought snapdragons had the power to protect them from witchcraft. Descorides, the Greek physician wrote that protection would be given to the person that wore snapdragons around their 
            neck. In the medieval period, snapdragons were thought to be the guardians of European castles and were planted near the gates. Women boiled snapdragons and applied the resulting infusion to their faces to 
            keep them beautiful and restore youth.

            Often we hear about another’s tragedy, and it makes us feel better about our own situation. This is quite
            different from what the Dalai Lama was doing. He was not contrasting his situation with others, but uniting
            his situation with others, enlarging his identity and seeing that he and the Tibetan people were not alone
            in their suffering. This recognition that we are all connected -- whether Tibetan Buddhists or Hui Muslims
            -- is the birth of empathy and compassion.
