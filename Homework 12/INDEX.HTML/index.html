    <h1>Exploring SnapDragons</h1>
    <h3>Antirrhinum is a genus of plants commonly known as dragon flowers or snapdragons because of the flowers' fancied resemblance to the face of a dragon that opens and closes its mouth when laterally squeezed.</h3>

            While their actual origin is unknown, it’s believed that snapdragons were originally wildflowers in Spain and Italy. This flower originated in the Mediterranean area but now thrives in the UK when planted 
            in well-fertilized soil in full sun. The English name derives from the flower’s imagined appearance as a dragon’s face. Snapdragons come in a wide variety of bright colors and a range of heights, from dwarf 
            to medium and tall. In addition to growing the plants for cut flowers, the seeds have been used to extract edible oils, while the leaves and flowers have been considered to possess anti-inflammatory properties.

            The Romans and Greeks thought snapdragons had the power to protect them from witchcraft. Descorides, the Greek physician wrote that protection would be given to the person that wore snapdragons around their 
            neck. In the medieval period, snapdragons were thought to be the guardians of European castles and were planted near the gates. Women boiled snapdragons and applied the resulting infusion to their faces to 
            keep them beautiful and restore youth.

            Often we hear about another’s tragedy, and it makes us feel better about our own situation. This is quite
            different from what the Dalai Lama was doing. He was not contrasting his situation with others, but uniting
            his situation with others, enlarging his identity and seeing that he and the Tibetan people were not alone
            in their suffering. This recognition that we are all connected -- whether Tibetan Buddhists or Hui Muslims
            -- is the birth of empathy and compassion.

            I wondered how the Dalai Lama’s ability to shift his perspective might relate to the adage "Pain is
            inevitable; suffering is optional." Was it truly possible to experience pain, whether the pain of an injury
            or an exile, without suffering? There is a Sutta, or teaching of the Buddha, called the Sallatha Sutta, that
            makes a similar distinction between our "feelings of pain" and "the suffering that comes as a result of our
            response" to the pain: "When touched with a feeling of pain, the uninstructed, ordinary person sorrows,
            grieves, and laments, beats his breast, becomes distraught. So he feels two pains, physical and mental. Just
            as if they were to shoot a man with an arrow and, right afterward, were to shoot him with another one, so
            that he feels the pain of two arrows." It seems that the Dalai Lama was suggesting that by shifting our
            perspective to a broader, more compassionate one, we can avoid the worry and suffering that is the second
            arrow.

        <div>
            "Then another thing," the Dalai Lama continued. "There are different aspects to any event. For example, we
            lost our own country and became refugees, but that same experience gave us new opportunities to see more
            things. For me personally, I had more opportunities to meet with different people, different spiritual
            practitioners, like you, and also scientists. This new opportunity arrived because I became a refugee. If I
            remained in the Potala in Lhasa, I would have stayed in what has often been described as a golden cage: the
            Lama, holy Dalai Lama." He was now sitting up stiffly as he once had to when he was the cloistered spiritual
            head of the Forbidden Kingdom.
        </div>
        <div>
            "So, personally, I prefer the last five decades of refugee life. It’s more useful, more opportunity to
            learn, to experience life. Therefore, if you look from one angle, you feel, oh how bad, how sad. But if you
            look from another angle at that same tragedy, that same event, you see that it gives me new opportunities.
            So, it’s wonderful. That’s the main reason that I’m not sad and morose. There’s a Tibetan saying: ‘Wherever
            you have friends that’s your country, and wherever you receive love, that’s your home.’"
