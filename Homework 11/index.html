        Development for The Lightning Thief began when author Rick Riordan made up stories for his son Haley, who had 
        been diagnosed with ADHD and dyslexia. His son had been studying Greek mythology in second grade and asked that 
        his father come up with bedtime stories based on Greek myths. Riordan had been a Greek mythology teacher in middle 
        school for many years and was able to remember enough stories to please his son. Soon Riordan ran out of myths and 
        his son requested that Riordan make new ones using the characters from Greek myths with a new twist. Riordan created 
        the fictional character Percy Jackson and his travels across the United States to recover Zeus' lightning bolt.

        Association Best Books for Young Adults, among other awards. It was adapted into a film named Percy Jackson & 
        the Olympians: The Lightning Thief released in the United States on February 12, 2010.

        The Lightning Thief received mostly positive reviews. The book has a rating of 4.25 out of 5 on Goodreads with over 
        1,900,000 reviews.[12] Common Sense Media said, "There are two levels of fun in The Lightning Thief. One is the 
        fast-paced quest of a young hero and his friends to save the world..." and added, "Another level of fun here – laughing
         at the wicked ways the author has updated the gods and monsters for the 21st century".

        Percy Jackson is a dyslexic twelve-year-old with ADHD.[P 1] While on a school trip to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, 
        one of the chaperones, Mrs. Dodds, turns into a Fury and attacks him.[P 2] Percy's favorite teacher, Mr. Brunner, lends 
        Percy a magical sword-pen to defeat her. Percy and his mother Sally go to Long Island. Percy's friend Grover reveals
         himself as a satyr and warns of danger. At a summer camp, Sally is attacked by a minotaur and disappears in a flash of 
         light. Percy kills the beast with one of its own horns. He learns that the camp is called Camp Half-Blood, and that he 
         is a demigod: the son of a human and a Greek god. He settles into camp life and meets several other demigods, including 
         Luke and Annabeth. After a hellhound attacks him, he is saved by Chiron and then claimed by his father, the god Poseidon. 
         Chiron explains to Percy how the three eldest male gods—Poseidon, Zeus, and Hades—swore an oath not to have children; Percy 
         represents a violation of the oath. He is the second violation of the oath, as the first was Thalia, daughter of Zeus. She 
         was killed by monsters sent by Hades. This, coupled with the fact that Zeus's master lightning bolt has recently been stolen,
          has bred much suspicion between the gods.

    <div class="fifth-paragraph">
        Percy must locate Zeus's lightning bolt. Annabeth and Grover accompany him to the realm of Hades—the most likely culprit.
         Percy brings Chiron's magic sword Anaklusmos and Luke's flying sneakers. The trio travels to Los Angeles to visit Hades. 
         Along the way, they are attacked by the Furies, Medusa, Echidna, and the Chimera. They perform a favor for the god Ares, 
         who gives them a backpack full of supplies and safe transportation to Nevada. Percy learns more about his companions, his 
         powers, and the world of the Greek gods. In Hades's realm, Grover is nearly dragged into Tartarus by Luke's flying shoes. 
         The battered group finally meets Hades, who reveals that his Helm of Darkness has also been mysteriously stolen, and accuses 
         Percy of stealing it. Hades threatens to kill his hostage Sally and reanimate the dead unless his helm is returned. When Percy
          finds the missing master bolt inside Ares's backpack, the group realizes they've all been manipulated by Ares. Narrowly escaping 
          the Underworld, Percy challenges Ares to a duel on the beach. After a long and tough fight, Percy wins, and he gives the Helm of
           Darkness to the Furies. Hades realizes that Percy is not the thief of the helm nor the master bolt, and returns Sally home.

        Percy takes the master bolt back to Zeus on Mount Olympus. Percy returns to Camp Half-Blood as a hero and enjoys the rest of his summer. On the last day 
        of camp, however, he goes into the woods with Luke, who reveals himself to be the real thief of Hades's Helm and Zeus's bolt, following the orders of Kronos. 
        Kronos had manipulated the power-hungry Ares into taking part in the scheme. Luke explains his beliefs that the gods are too irresponsible and are poor leaders 
        who need to be overthrown. He offers Percy the chance to join him, and when Percy refuses, Luke tries to kill him with a scorpion. Percy is poisoned and faints.
         Awakening, he is given the choice of whether to return home for the school year or stay at camp year-round. He decides to spend the school year with his mother, 
         even though it will be more dangerous for him with Luke and Kronos on the loose. Grover and Annabeth also leave the camp for the year but promise to keep in touch 
         with Percy.
