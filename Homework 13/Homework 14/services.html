         We are back to bar ordering and full capacity. When you come in grab a table, place your order up at the bar, grab your beer, and we‚Äôll bring your food out to you!
        Tables will be sanitized by our staff between guests, but if it makes you feel better to do any additional cleaning we have sanitation stations placed around the taproom. 
        Takeout continues for those evenings when you just want to pick up some pizza to bring home! üç∫

Because this list is ever changing, we cannot guarantee 100% accuracy. To start we only have western Montana location listed but fear not, our delicious craft beer can be found all across the state!
